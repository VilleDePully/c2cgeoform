Prerequisites
=============

The following system packages must be installed on your system:

-  ``python-virtualenv``
-  ``libpq-dev`` (header files for PostgreSQL)
-  ``gettext``

On Windows, you should install ``make`` using Cygwin (and put the bin
folder into the path). For Python, please use Python >= 3.x.

You need to install PostgreSQL and PostGIS. On Ubuntu, the packages
``postgresql-server-dev-9.3`` and ``python-dev`` are required.
